What difficulties could be expected in a generic multiple number adder if the count of numbers is not a power of two or if the count is not pre-defined?
- We are using the adders with 2 input ports which a require a power of 2 adders so that 
every output can be directed to a new layer of adders.
- If the count is not pre-defined, it is difficult to instantiate the number of adders
to fulfill this calculation.

What is the difference between VHDL's architecture levels structural and RTL?
-Structural is a structure of a sequential component 'adder' which operates as a 
combinational component. The structural does not use clock and register directly 
but through its sub-components

How is hierarchical design implemented with VHDL?
- In VHDL we seperate the bigger task into smaller task which can be seen as simple entity.
And then instantiate them as sub-components/
