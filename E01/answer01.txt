1) In lock.vhd, state machine need to be updated for the state code_2. Else part is not handled properly.

2) WHEN code_2 =>
            IF (to_integer(UNSIGNED(keys_in)) = third_c) THEN
               next_state <= code_3;
            ELSE
               next_state <= code_3;
            END IF;

This state always success irrespective of the input key.


3)

Force commands are manually typed for every input and simulate. Where as in testbench,
inputs are generated automatically based on the conditions, also it is readable.

There are 4 states in the state machine
