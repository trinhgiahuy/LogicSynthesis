Configuration value DAI_CTRL
Address: 0x29 (0010 1001)	found from page 62
Value: 1000 0001			from page 76.

There are 7 states in the FSM :

type state_tpye is (start_cond, 				--start condition
					wait_ack					--wait acknowledgement
					slave_addr_trans, 			--slave address transmit
					reg_add_trans,				--register address transmit
					data_trans					--data transmit
					stop_cond,					--stop condition
					finished					--finished
					);


We will have a register signal for storing parameter index and current bit index.
The machine state start from start_cond to finished and repeats 15 times.
In each time slave_address, register_address and data will be transmited sequentially.

ACK or NACK will be read after each byte and if NACK is receive, it will turn back to start_cond
Finally, after finishing all transmission, the finished output will be set 1.
