* What difficulties could be expected in a generic multiple number adder if the count of numbers is not a power of two or if the count is not pre-defined?

Ans : If the count of numbers is not power of 2 we will have to use another stage to add one of the subtotals with the 5th operand and this will introduce extra delay.
If the count of operands is not predefined we will not know the number of adder components to use and also the size of the subtotal array will be undetermined.

* What is the difference between VHDL's architecture levels structural and RTL? 
Ans : Structural level means that we divide our code into smaller structures and we instantiate them into our code and we can re-use these components any time.
RTL means Register Transfer Level and we describe the control path and data path inside the code and we perform logical and arithmetic operations directly in our code.

* How is hierarchical design implemented with VHDL?
Ans : we create the component itself (low level) and then we map these components' ports to the high level ports and signals. In this example we created the adder component
as the low level and then we mapped it's operands with the operands_in as input and subtotal in the multi port adder as the top level.
