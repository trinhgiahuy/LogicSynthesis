We created a top level "Saloon Piano" to be used instead of the synthesizer component.
The Saloon Piano module has the frequencies of melody notes (C, D, G ,etc) of the song "Twinkle twinkle little star" ¨
stored in an array and every second we are playing the corresponding tone of the melody.
The wave generated in this module is actually the "Synthesizable Sine Wave Generator" created in Exercise "Bonus 2: Generation of Sine Wave".
The whole melody is just controlled by the reset button, if we push it high the melody plays automatically.
